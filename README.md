# EfficientDet: Scalable and Efficient Object Detection

This is a project intended to show EfficientDet object detectors family at work.
This is a family of convolutional neural networks that aims to achieve 
state-of-the-art accuracy while using fewer parameters than state-of-the-art object detectors

In particular, I propose a fine-tuning of the model into the Global Wheat Detection dataset from Kaggle.
